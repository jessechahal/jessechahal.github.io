          In this programming competition the goal was to take a sequential based multi robot simulation and create an optimized version. This was done through algorithm optimizations, threading, compiler optimizations, and distributing the computations across multiple servers. The distributed system was a hybrid between a P2P system and a client/server architecture.

          Decaf is a strongly typed, object-oriented language resembling a subset of Java. Flex/lex was used to create a lexical analyzer using regular expressions to tokenize the source code. Bison was used to create the parser which read input from the lexical analyzer. llvm was used to create the semantic analyzer, with input from the parser, allowed the generation of a unique compiler. With the power of llvm it became possible to create compilers for different cpu architectures although in this case the focus was on x86.
